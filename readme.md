   git clone https://github.com/shaweesh/pydrive
   cd pydrive
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash

   quart==0.19.6
   telethon==1.36.0
   firebase-admin==6.5.0
   aiofiles==24.1.0
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Create `config.py`** in the project root directory with the following content:

   ```python
   api_id = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_API_ID'
   api_hash = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_API_HASH'
   ```

   - Replace `'YOUR_ACTUAL_API_ID'` with the API ID you obtained from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
   - Replace `'YOUR_ACTUAL_API_HASH'` with the API hash you obtained from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).

   ### Example of `config.py`

   Here's how `config.py` might look with placeholder values replaced:

   ```python
   api_id = '123456'          # Your actual API ID
   api_hash = 'abcdef123456'  # Your actual API hash
   ```

2. **Place your Firebase service account key** file as `serviceAccountKey.json` in the project root directory.

3. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

1. **Login**: Open the application in your browser and enter your phone number on the login page.

2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: After entering your phone number, you'll be prompted to enter a two-factor authentication password.

3. **Dashboard**: Once authenticated, youâ€™ll be directed to the dashboard where you can upload files and view/manage existing attachments.

4. **File Upload**: Drag and drop files or use the file picker to upload files. Files will be listed with options to download or delete.
